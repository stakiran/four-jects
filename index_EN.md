## Four-jects
### Project
- Pro + ject: an activity to move forward
- Consists of project management based on allocated resources, plus teamwork by either static or fluid members
- A temporary endeavor that always has a beginning and an end

### Transject
- Trans + ject: an activity to cross boundaries
- Consists of solo work that produces shareable deliverables, broadcasting them to all employees, and handling individual Q&A and requests
- A permanent endeavor: you keep operating as an individual player without having a team or a project

### Preject
- Pre + ject: activities performed before a project
- Not Waterfall, not Agile, but exploratory. You decide only a theme and a timebox; during that period, each person explores freely without management, meetings, or interference
- A temporary endeavor: once it ends, you immediately share results, run a retrospective, and decide what comes next

### Coject
- Co + ject: an activity to spend time together
- During work hours, you do non-work social activities such as conversations, games, retreats, and other recreation
- A temporary endeavor: you inject the human interactions people need as appropriate

## Relationships

- 1
    - If you need exploration before starting a Project, do a Preject. Exploration works better when you remove constraints as much as possible and let each person go all-in on their own pace and strengths, with deep focus. **It doesn't fit well with a management-heavy, teamwork-heavy Project.**
- 2
    - To move forward, you need a Project
- 3 
    - A Project is teamwork-oriented, and it often carries unnecessary communication and social interaction
    - Normally, you should keep that to the minimum. But because we're human, we can't endure that alone, so you introduce Cojects. The idea is to do them at a high density **separately**. In other words, separate project activities from social activities
- 4
    - The talent for solving problems and the talent for defining problems can't coexist. A Solver should do Projects, but it's absurd to make a Creator do Projects. Also, there are quite a lot of people who aren't suited to being Solvers, likely as many as sexual minorities and neurodivergent people, or even more
    - Exempt the latter from Projects and have them fully commit to Transjects instead. And to ensure their outcomes get brought into Projects, also provide (have them provide) sustained delivery
